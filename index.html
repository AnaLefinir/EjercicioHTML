                Set in Hawkins in the fall of 1984, the story continues as supernatural forces once again begin to affect the town. While
                the season services the first season's core cast and characters first and foremost,several new characters
                are introduced: tomboy Max and her older step-brother Billy, a woman named Kali connected to Hawkins Lab,
                RadioShack manager Bob Newby, Department of Energy agent Dr. Owens and disgraced journalist-turned-conspiracy
                theorist Murray Bauman.
